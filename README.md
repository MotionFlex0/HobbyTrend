## We can start working on the stuff below (design using bootstrap and jquery etc.)

###### Currently 2 apps
user - contains the custom user class (it should have the the specification. dob, profile pic etc.)

accounts - This extends the current functionally provided by the auth module (in this case, I have added a signup view)

###### Templates

templates/base.html - This file contains the header and footer, which should appear on all pages.

templates/login.html - This file is what will appear when the user goes to '<OUR_WEBSITE>/accounts/login.

templates/signup.html - This file is what will appear when the user goes to '<OUR_WEBSITE>/accounts/signup.

###### Other notes
The user model still needs to be finished.

Hopefully, this is a good starting point
